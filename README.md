<ol>
    <li><h3>Clone the repo and open the project folder</h3></li>

    <li><h3>First thing to do is run the command "npm install" to install all the dependancies, you do not need to run this command because I downloaded all the dependancies into the node_modules folder, but I'd suggest to do it since it is safer to know everything is installed perfectly.</h3></li>
</ol>
